# **File explorer**
This repository contains a Qt project I had to make for a third bachelor course that focused on using C++ with visual studio.
<br />The Qt project consists of making a file explorer that is able to load in folders, subfolders, and the files they contain. All the files are text files containing information about a person. Using this info, you can filter the files based on different attributes such as name, age, etc.
